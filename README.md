# Flex

Flex is a flexible Plex-like media browser for local content. Flex's main feature is 'Shelves', the ability to add rows of dynamic collections of content with a simple but powerful custom query language. For example, a row could be ([Action] AND {Year > 2010}) OR ({Accessed < 13/02/2022} AND (![TV SHOW] OR |The Simpsons|)).
